FYI - this doesn't do anything yet other than cli flow/logic and baits you into thinking it's doing a thing.

## GWOP - An attempt at developing an interactive implant creator/dropper/packer/thing  
  
I've started playing around in HTB again recently and keep getting meh'd out my msfvenom and spinning up msf itself to catch the payloads. Figured I'd wrap it all into a nice little interactive cli tool.  
  
Not only that, but this will also create an implant that will (in theory) bypass protections on the target box and then spin up the actual payload once deployed on the target box. Ideally, this will only be used to gain a better foothold without worrying about transferring an implant that has been generated by something that has been sig'd 6.92 billion times (press F for msfvenom). It's likely this won't be flawless. It's very likely this won't even work but meh, I like coding, I like open sourcing stuff, and well, hopefully y'all like the attempt. So let's all enjoy free code :)  
  
### Platforms  
Developed and tested on OSX, but Makefile has args for Windows (implant only), Linux (cli and implant) and OSX (cli and implant)  
    
### Other
If you're a skid like me, don't be a dick with this. If it works and bypasses stuff - don't hack your nan and flex on Twitter with it. Please.  
  
There may be some artefacts from DaaC2 as I used that as a base, but anyway - no harm done RIGHT?!
